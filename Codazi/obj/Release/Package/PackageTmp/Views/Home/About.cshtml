                As a software development firm, we build software solutions for everyday challenges. It might be a standalone application, or bridging a gap between two or more pieces of existing software.

                The solution you need might be a standalone application or integration between two or more pieces of existing software. However, our primary focus is solving problems experienced 
                in professional services firms.  We know that beautifully designed software is just one part of the equation, that’s why our services also include Product Management,
                Product Marketing, and Project Management. Codazi focuses on making the entire product lifecycle process run smoothly, from the initial design to final delivery.
